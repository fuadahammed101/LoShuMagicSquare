🔢 Lo Shu Magic Square Checker – C++
This repository contains a beginner-friendly C++ program to check whether a given 3×3 grid is a Lo Shu Magic Square — a special kind of magic square where the numbers 1 through 9 appear exactly once and every row, column, and diagonal sums to 15.

📚 About the Lo Shu Magic Square
The Lo Shu Square is the earliest known magic square, appearing in ancient Chinese mathematics. In a Lo Shu Magic Square:

The grid is 3×3.

Each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once.

The sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same — 15.

💻 Program Features
Takes user input for a 3x3 grid.

Validates if all numbers are unique and between 1 to 9.

Checks if the sums of rows, columns, and both diagonals equal 15.

Displays whether the grid is a valid Lo Shu Magic Square or not.

"Please enter the desire grid dimension: 3 3
Please input the 3x3 grid:
2 7 6
9 5 1
4 3 8

Please output for 3 x 3 Grid:
2   7   6
9   5   1
4   3   8

This is a Lo Shu Magic Square.
And, the magic number is 15.

Thank you!!!"
